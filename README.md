## ðŸ‘‰ Bullseye
The [**'old' Buster OS**](https://github.com/Qengineering/RPi-image) is still available.<br><br>
Regularly, we get the question if we have an image of our Raspberry Pi with some frameworks and [our deep-learning examples](https://qengineering.eu/deep-learning-examples-on-raspberry-32-64-os.html). We are happy to comply with this request.

------------

## Installation.

- Get a 32 GB SD-card which will hold the image. 
- Download the image Rpi_Bullseye_64_DNN.xz (**4 GByte !**) from [Sync](https://ln5.sync.com/dl/4083226a0/e7t6w7jp-x4vqthff-8v9fxzuh-9y84f2x4).
- Flash the image on the SD-card with the [Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
- Insert the SD-card in your Raspberry Pi 4.
- Wait a few minutes, while the image will expand to the full size of your SD card.
- No WiFi installed. Password: ***3.14***

------------

## Tips.

* Default, the Raspberry Pi is been overclocked to 1850 MHz. See [overclock the Raspberry Pi](https://qengineering.eu/overclocking-the-raspberry-pi-4.html) for more information.<br/>
* If you are in need of extra space, you can delete the opencv and the opencv_contrib folder from the SD-card. There are no longer needed since all libraries are placed in the /usr/local directory.

## WiFi.

Since everyone has a unique password on their WiFi connection, we have not activated the WiFi.<br/>
To enable the wireless LAN follow the next steps:<br/>

1) Left click on the Ethernet symbol.<br/><br/>

2) Click "Turn on wireless LAN", and wait a few seconds. Your RPi will scan for available networks.<br/><br/>

3) Left click again on the Ethernet symbol and choose your network.<br/><br/>

4) Give your key, and wait a couple of seconds to let the RPi establish the connection.<br/><br/>

## Camera.

You can connect a camera to the given C++ examples. With Buster, it was simple. You replaced the filename with a zero (0) and got the images from the RaspiCam instead of a file. Those days are gone with the introduction of Bullseye.

You can use G

## OpenCV + TensorFlow.

Importing both TensorFlow and OpenCV in Python can throw the error: _cannot allocate memory in static TLS block_.<br/>
This behaviour only occurs on an aarch64 system and is caused by the OpenMP memory requirements not being met.<br/>
For more information, see GitHub ticket [#14884](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/14884).<br/>

![output image](https://qengineering.eu/images/SwapImportOpenCVRPi.png)

There are a few solutions. The easiest is to import OpenCV at the beginning, as shown above.<br/>
The other is disabling OpenMP by setting the -DBUILD_OPENMP and -DWITH_OPENMP flags OFF.<br/>
Where possible, OpenCV will now use the default pthread or the TBB engine for parallelization.<br/>
We don't recommend it. Not all OpenCV algorithms automatically switch to pthread.<br/>
Our advice is to import OpenCV into Python first before anything else.<br/>
